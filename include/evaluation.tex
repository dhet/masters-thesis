\subsection{Limitations to the Approach}

The benchmarks in the previous chapter demonstrated that the approach to cloud connectivity given in this thisis is fully functional. However, there are some limitation that need to be addressed.

Firstly, Weave Net is not designed to be used in safety critical systems. On their website, Weaveworks make no statement about any certification efforts that make the software suitable for the use in safety-critical systems. Thus, for the time being, the given approach may only find applicability for non-safety critical functions, \eg in the context infotainment systems. However, it may be added that Weave Net is Open Source, and as such, all underlying technologies and concepts are disclosed. Thus, it is feasible to implement a formally verified version of Wave Net tailored towards safety-critical systems.
