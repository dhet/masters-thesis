\section{Distributed Systems}

"A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system" \cite{tanenbaum2017distributed}

made up of a number of hardware devices and/or software processes called \emph{nodes}

there are open groups, which every node may join, and closed groups, which employ an authorization mechanism to control access.

\emph{Distribution transparency}: See Tanenbaum section 1.2

A requirement for distributed applications is the need to pass messages, or data, between different threads of execution. For this purpose, \emph{middlewares} \cite{bernstein1996middleware} are commonly used. 


How are cars distributed systems?

\paragraph{Challenges} In a distributed system, single parts may fail while others keep functioning properly.  This may lead to unexpected behavior.

\section{Communication}

What has been discussed so far is what services are and how they can be implemented. One question that remains is how they are connected. 

Which communication patterns are there?

push vs. pull,
unicast vs. multicast
synchronous vs. asynchronous
centralized vs. decentralized

What makes PubSub especially attractive?
PubSub enables loose coupling. No apriori knowledge of communication partners required. Hardware independence: Services may be migrated between computing nodes. Abstraction of underlying infrastructure is important.
No startup dependencies: The order in which services finish initializing is irrelevant. Especially important with ephemeral services.
