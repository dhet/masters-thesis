\section{Distributed Systems}

Control systems in modern vehicles are typically implemented as a collection of dozens, if not hundreds, of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) dispersed within a vehicle. There are several reasons why dispersion is preferable over a centralized approach. By bringing ECUs closer to the sensors and actuators they control, wiring effort is kept low, which results in low message transmission latencies, decreased weight, and reduced proneness to errors. 

Such E/E-Architectures\footnote{Electric/Electronic}, being comprised of a large number of distributed, connected sensors, actuators and control units, fall into the category of \emph{distributed systems}. The term "distributed system" entails many things and just as many definitions of the term exist. A definition that most would agree upon is the one given by \citeauthor*{tanenbaum2017distributed} \cite{tanenbaum2017distributed}: 
\begin{quote}
"A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements that appears to its users as a single coherent system."
\end{quote}

The first aspect to consider in this definition is the notion of \emph{accumulation}. Distributed systems are made up of a number of \emph{nodes} which may occur in the form of either hardware devices, or software processes. Nodes can be joined together to form \emph{groups}. There are open groups, which every node may join, and closed groups, which employ an authorization mechanism to control access. 

Furthermore, the definition names \emph{autonomy} as a characteristic of distributed systems.
behave independently

Another aspect in the definition above is the notion of \emph{coherence}.
To users, a distributed system presents itself as a single entity
Nodes need to be connected

The recent trend to connect vehicles to the cloud adds another dimension to their distributed nature.


\paragraph{Challenges} In a distributed system, single parts may fail while others keep functioning properly.  This may lead to unexpected behavior.

\subsection{Distribution Transparency}

\section{Middlewares}
A prerequisite for the coherence property of distributed systems is the need for nodes to engage in collaboration. More precisely, distributed applications need a way to pass messages, or data, between different threads of execution. For this purpose, \emph{middlewares} \cite{bernstein1996middleware} are commonly used. Although message passing is a prime example of a middleware's use case, there are many other important concepts for which middlewares exist, \eg , transaction management in database systems. The primary goal of middlewares is to abstract away such concepts so that programmers can focus on implementing business logic and shipping features, instead of having to deal with the underlying specifics. Middlewares are implemented as a software layer that sits between operating system and the actual applications. They are often included in the form of libraries that make the middleware's functionality available to the programmers by means of an Application Programming Interface (API). 

The need for middlewares becomes particularly evident in the example of \emph{messaging}. Messages need to be sent over a physical mediums which are often, by nature, unreliable. To ensure reliability, many things need to be taken care of, \eg , error detection, repetition mechanisms, etc. In addition, guarantees must be given that messages are delivered to the right receivers. Therefore, addressing and routing mechanisms must be in place. These are just a few examples of things related to messaging. Managing these things manually, and implementing according measures from the ground up is hardly manageable for programmers. Messaging middlewares are a good way to streamline this process. An exemplary messaging middleware may be included in a software project in the form of a library which exposes an API. In the following, all the programmer needs to do to send messages is to invoke a simple function, \eg , \texttt{middleware.sendBroadcast("Hello, World!")}. The middleware then ensures that the message is delivered to the right recipients over whichever transport is available. To receive messages, the programmer may, in the case of this exemplary middleware, define a callback function which the middleware calls automatically whenever a new message is available. The callback function could have the form \texttt{void receive(string message, string sender) \{ /*...*/ \}}.

\section{Cloud Computing}

The idea of cloud computing is to provide access to remote computing resources  (\eg , networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) in a convenient, on-demand manner \cite{mell2011nist}. Customers can rent these resources to use them at their will. By outsourcing their IT infrastructure into the cloud, companies can significantly reduce capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX/OPEX) that are typically associated with running an on-premise infrastructure. Other benefits include easier maintenance and accelerated time-to-market times. Several pricing models for cloud services exist. Customers often have the choice between a set monthly fee, or they may pay on a pay-per-use basis.

Cloud infrastructures are typically implemented as multi-tenancy systems in which the same hardware is shared among many customers ("resource pooling"). An enabling technology for this is virtualization. Each customer is assigned one or more virtual machines (VMs) running on one or more physical servers. For its users, the alloted computing environment appears as a single, isolated physical machine. The amount of disposable resources can be controlled for each VM individually, allowing for fine-grained resource tuning according to demand.

A major selling point of cloud computing is scalability. Many cloud providers allow for the dynamic allocation of resources depending on demand. To customers, the available resources appear as if they were unlimited when in actuality the substrate resources are alloted and released under the hood in an elastic manner. To steer this behavior, \emph{elasticity controllers} can be employed by which rules can be defined to control when and how scaling measures are performed. \Eg , when a CPU utilization threshold is reached, the system can be instructed to automatically launch an application replica. Subsequently, a load balancer can be used to distribute the load between the instances \cite{vaquero2011dynamically}.


\paragraph{}
Cloud computing presents itself in the form of several usage models. The most notable ones are: \emph{Infrastructure as a Service} (IaaS),  \emph{Platform as a Service} (PaaS),  and \emph{Software as a Service} (SaaS) \cite{mell2011nist}.

\begin{description}
\item[IaaS] In the IaaS model, sheer, usually virtualized, hardware is provided, on which customers can install and run arbitrary software. Customers have only basic control over their virtual infrastructure's hardware composition, but may take influence on the operating system level.
\item[PaaS] The PaaS model presents a higher level view on the infrastructure. In this model, customers don't have full control over their VM instance. Instead, they can deploy their software in predefined application-hosting environments \cite{mell2011nist} which are typically centered around a certain technology, \eg\ .NET, or node.js, etc. Examples for this type of services are Microsoft Azure or Google App Engine.
\item[SaaS] Finally, the SaaS model is the highest level of cloud services. SaaS typically describes applications which are hosted on cloud platforms. These applications are usually provided by means of thin clients, most notably web browsers. Customers, which are mostly end users, have the least control over the cloud service and can only take influence via application-level configurations \cite{mell2011nist}. Examples of SaaS applications are Gmail or YouTube.

\section{Real-time Systems}

\section{Safety-critical Systems}
A system is considered emph{failed} when it cannot meet its promises. [Tanenbaum, S 426]

An \emph{error} may lead to system failure.

A \emph{fault} is the cause of an error. Faults can be caused by bugs in the software or unforeseeable circumstances. Some faults are avoidable and some are out of the control of the system developers. Nevertheless, all faults need to be dealt with.

A \emph{transient fault} is one that affects the system temporarily and can be circumvented by repeating the same operation.

An \emph{intermittent fault} occurs on and off, seemingly out of nowhere, without being reproducible .

A \emph{permanent fault} is one that persists until the root of the fault is found and repaired.

\emph{Fault tolerance} is a systems ability to continue operation, even in the presence of faults.

Failure masking by redundancy: three types: information r. (hamming code), time r. (repeat error), physical r. (redundant processes or hardware)

\section{Networking}

\subsection{Multicast}

In distributed systems, information frequently needs to be propagated to multiple receivers simultaneously. This kind of communication is called \emph{multicast}.

benefits: No hard-coded addresses

Multicast can be implemented on both, network and application-level.

Support for multicast in WANs is rather limited.



\subsection{Overlay Networks}

An overlay network is a logical network which connects peers in a peer-to-peer network. Naturally, in order to enable information exchange, overlay networks require a substrate physical network over which data can be transmitted. The important thing is that overlay networks are entirely decoupled from the physical infrastructure such that both networks may evolve (change topology) independently without affecting one another. As opposed to physical networks, which connect \emph{physical machines}, overlay networks connect \emph{processes}. There are two types of overlay networks: \emph{structured} and \emph{unstructured} overlay networks. In the former, peers are organized in a specific, deterministic manner, such that each node has its firm place and an immutable set of neighbors. Unstructured overlay networks, on the other hand, allow the topology to change dynamically. In order for this to work, each node maintains an ad-hoc list of neighbors that is to be updated continuously \cite{tanenbaum2017distributed}. In the context of this thesis, unstructured overlay networks are of particular interest due to the dynamic nature and the reliability characteristics of mobile systems.


Examples of overlay networks are VPNs, Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and voice over IP (VoIP)

Ethernet virtualization: VLAN tags to separate traffic and to build L2/L3 overlays.
